# SaboteurComp424
Development of a final project for the comp 424 mcGill course

Please, find in mycourses - discussion - Final project a tutorial for the installation of the project.

Update: 23/03:
  Several bug were fixed:
    - the deck has now the good number of map, which is 6 map instead of 4.
    - a problem with the initilization of player's instance of BoardState is fixed.
    - the path to the background image is now better managed, and should work under all OS.
    
the Autoplay class is not working yet, I will try to get this out as soon as possible, but you should not need this in the beginning of your project. 
Thank you for your comments and help to spot these mistakes.

Good luck,

Pierre
